## Project Overview
The main goal of the project was to create an application aimed at expanding knowledge in the field of human anatomy, specifically the muscular system. The web application facilitates learning anatomy by providing numerous graphics taken from anatomical atlases, illustrating the structure of the human muscular system. Users, upon logging into the application using the login module, are redirected to a quiz consisting of 5 randomly selected questions from a pool of many stored in the database. To proceed to the next question, the user must select their chosen answer. After answering all questions, a summary panel is displayed, showing the obtained score, the time taken to complete the test, and the option to view correct answers compared with those selected by the user. There is also an option to save the result to the database, where users can compare their results with others.

## Progress
- Created a database of questions and answers for the quiz using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Initiated the application window in React using Visual Studio Code
- Developed the graphical user interface
- Implemented a login module for the application and saved user data to the database
- Utilized ASP .NET Core 6.0 to create the server and handle database queries and operations.
